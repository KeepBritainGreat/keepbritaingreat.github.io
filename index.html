                            EU immigrants contribute a massive 34% more in taxes than they take out. They're also highly likely to work in public services such as the NHS.<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup><br>

                            Britain pays £9 billion into the EU budget every year.<sup>[5]</sup><br>
                            <br>
                            It sounds like a lot, but it's only about 6% of the annual cost of the NHS, 10% of state pensions, and about the same as we spend on foreign aid - money we give away as charity.<sup>[6]</sup><br>
                            <br>
                            In return, we get a leading seat at the table of the world's biggest trading bloc. The economic boost we get from this is worth far more than its cost.<br>
                            <br>
                            We also get EU investment in parts of the country usually ignored by Westminster, like the Midlands, the North of England and Wales.<br>
                            <br>
                            For example, the new Midland Metropolitan Hospital near Birmingham recently received £108m in EU funding towards its construction.<sup>[7]</sup><br>
